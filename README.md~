# Comparison between OSM and authoritative road network datasets
This repository contains scripts for comparing road network datasets from [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](http://openstreetmap.org) and an authoritative source. The repository contains two folders:
* [GRASS-scripts](https://github.com/MoniaMolinari/OSM-roads-comparison/tree/master/GRASS-scripts) provides three Python modules to perform the complete dataset comparison in [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/)
* [WPS_OSM-REF-Comparison](https://github.com/GabrielePrestifilippo/WPS_OSM-REF-Comparison) provides the code to setup the Web Processing Service (WPS) for a preliminary comparison of the datasets

Detailed instructions on how to use the tools are provided in each of the two folders.
